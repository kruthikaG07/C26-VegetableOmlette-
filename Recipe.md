Here is a detailed Step-by-Step description on how to make the omlette:
Step 1: Crack one or two eggs into a bowl and slightly beat the eggs, but not too much, because beating the eggs too much will make the mixture too loose and the vegetables won't be able to bind with the egg mixture. 
Step 2: Cut all your vegetables(capsicum,carrots,cabbage,mushrooms,tomatoes etc.),the smaller the peices the better!
Step 3: Slide your vegetables into the eggs and stir!
Step 4: Pour the mixture onto the pan on medium heat.
Step 5: When ready, flip the omlette and sprinkle mozzeralla cheese or place a cheese slice in the middle of the omlette and roll the omlette.
Step 6: This is optional but I love to eat my omlette by putting it in between 2 slices of bread!
Step 7: Enjoy this delicous omlette at any point in the day or as a midnight snack(although I normally eat it as breakfast)!
