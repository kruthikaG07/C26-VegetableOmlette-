Today I will be teaching you how to make one of my favorite breakfasts, a vegetable omlette! It's a simple and delicious dish, on top of that it's very healthy. This vegetable omlette can be enjoyed in so many different ways, for example you could just it plain, with sauce or eat as a sandwich by putting it in between 2 pieces of bread! There are so many ways to make this omlette and here is my version of it! Hope you enjoy it!
